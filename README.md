# Custom Word Motions for VSCode

This allows you to specify a regex in your settings file and then have the
cursor move by the start, end or both start and end of boundaries of that regex.

As a bonus one version of the command allows you to select a whole word
that's under the cursor.

This is still early days. More documentation to come.
